# Dogeared 🐕📖

**Build a reading life.** A premium, social reading companion — Strava for readers, with the emotional intelligence of Letterboxd. Pure HTML/CSS/JS. No install, no build step, no backend. Runs from any folder, installs to any homescreen, works offline.

## What's in this build

- **Floating iOS-style dock** — rounded, glass-blurred, anchored with margin (not edge-to-edge). The session timer button is a large, raised, high-contrast circle floating dead-center above the dock — unmistakably the primary action.
- **Cinematic onboarding** — genre picks → mood picks → a daily page dial → your name. Every pick seeds a real recommendation engine, not just a preferences form.
- **Discover** — a vertical snap feed of full-bleed book cards. The search icon stays fixed on screen while you scroll. Skip a book and it's gone for good. **Deal me more** never repeats what you've already been shown in this session, and quietly pulls fresh candidates live from Open Library once the local pool runs low.
- **Reflective Journaling — now on the Homepage.** No separate tab; your two most recent entries sit right on Home with a **New entry** button and an **Edit** button on each, plus a "See all entries" link to the full journal list (also editable there). Four entry kinds — Reflection, Character, Analysis, Quote — each with its own prompt set, and up to 4 photo attachments per entry.
- **Live book search** via Open Library, sticky search bar so it doesn't scroll away from long result lists.
- **Sessions like workouts** — the timer card now fills nearly the full screen (space reserved below for "Save a quote mid-read"), with a timestamp-based clock that survives lock/close, a page slider, mood tagging, then a full-screen animated summary with an XP pop.
- **Share cards** — 9:16, laid out with a fully dynamic text flow (long or short titles never overlap the author line — verified against titles that wrap to 1, 2, or 3 lines). Three background styles to choose from: **Cover theme** (a gradient sampled directly from the book's own cover art), **Classic** (the signature Dogeared gold→ochre→ember gradient, muted for legibility), and **Transparent** (no fill, no cover — just white text, for overlaying your own photo). Every card is always anchored to a real book cover when one exists. A date stamp sits under the kicker as dated proof. Every card you generate — even if closed without sharing — is saved to **Profile → Recent shares** for re-sending later.
- **Monthly Wrap** — a Spotify-Wrapped-style recap that auto-generates once each month closes: a swipeable, story-style viewer covering the stat breakdown, a cover collage, your standout saved quote, a month-over-month comparison, an encouraging note on quiet months, and a next-month goal nudge.
- **Gamification with restraint** — XP/levels and 15 achievements, all rendered with a single-color icon system (no emoji, except the mid-session "how's it feel?" mood picker, which keeps its emoji on purpose).
- **Appearance** — light/dark toggle lives only in Profile. Dark mode gives the (dark-inked) logo mark a lighter halo so it's never dark-on-dark.
- **Optional cloud sync** — sign in with Google from Profile to back up your shelf and pick it up on another device. Entirely additive: skip it and the app works exactly as it always has, fully offline, no account. See "Set up cloud sync" below to enable it for your own deployment.
- **Local-first** — everything lives in `localStorage`. JSON export/import for backup or moving devices.

## Run it

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
# or: npx serve .
```
Open `http://localhost:8080`. (Opening `index.html` directly works too, minus the offline service worker, which needs `http://` or `https://`.)

## Install to homescreen

- **iOS Safari:** Share → Add to Home Screen
- **Android Chrome:** menu → Install app
- **Desktop Chrome/Edge:** install icon in the address bar

## The Android app

There's an official Android app in `android/`, published as a signed APK on
this repo's [Releases](https://github.com/wegatherstudio/dogeared/releases)
page. Android visitors to `landing.html` are auto-detected and pointed at
`install-android.html`, which walks them through the sideload.

It's a **Trusted Web Activity** — a native shell that opens this very site
fullscreen, with no address bar, using the phone's browser engine. That means
there is no second copy of the UI to keep in sync: the Android app renders the
same HTML/CSS/JS as the web app and picks up changes the moment you push to
`main`. You only need a new APK when something app-level changes — the name,
the icon, the launch URL, the splash.

### How the pieces fit

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Android project | `android/` — package `studio.wegather.dogeared` |
| Build + release | `.github/workflows/android-release.yml` |
| Install guide | `install-android.html` |
| Site-side verification | `.well-known/assetlinks.json` in the **`wegatherstudio.github.io`** repo |

The address bar only disappears if both halves of the Digital Asset Links
handshake agree: the app names the site (`asset_statements` in
`android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`) and the site names the app's
signing certificate (`assetlinks.json`). That file must be served from the
**domain root**, not `/dogeared/` — which is why it lives in the separate
`wegatherstudio.github.io` repo, alongside a `.nojekyll` file so GitHub Pages
doesn't strip the dot-directory.

### Cutting a release

Push a tag and the workflow builds, signs, verifies and publishes the APK:

```bash
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```

Pushes to the Android branch build the APK too, without releasing it, so
breakage surfaces before you tag. The signing key is never committed — CI
restores it from two repository secrets, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` and
`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`.

> **Keep a backup of the signing keystore.** If it's lost, you can't ship an
> update to anyone who already installed the app — they'd have to uninstall
> and reinstall. The build fails loudly if the APK's certificate stops matching
> the fingerprint published in `assetlinks.json`.

### Building it locally

Put your `keystore.jks` in `android/` and run:

```bash
cd android
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=... gradle assembleRelease
# → app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

Requires JDK 17 and the Android SDK (compileSdk 35). Without a keystore the
build still runs and produces an unsigned APK.

## Deploy free on GitHub Pages

```bash
git init && git add . && git commit -m "Dogeared"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dogeared.git
git push -u origin main
```
Then **Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main / (root)**. Live in a minute at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/dogeared/`.

## Set up cloud sync (optional — Google sign-in)

The app works completely offline with no account, exactly as before. This section is only if you want to add **"Sign in with Google"** so people can back up their shelf and pick it up on another device.

### 1. Create a Firebase project
1. Go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) → **Add project** → give it any name → you can skip Google Analytics.
2. Once created, click the **web icon (`</>`)** to register a web app. Name it anything (e.g. "Dogeared"). You don't need Firebase Hosting — you're already using GitHub Pages.
3. Firebase will show you a `firebaseConfig` object. Copy those values into **`js/firebase-config.js`** in this project, replacing the `YOUR_...` placeholders.

### 2. Turn on Google sign-in
In the Firebase console: **Build → Authentication → Get started → Sign-in method → Google → Enable → Save.**

### 3. Add your GitHub Pages domain as authorized
Still in Authentication: **Settings tab → Authorized domains → Add domain** → add `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io` (Firebase auto-adds `localhost`, so local testing works immediately).

### 4. Create the database
**Build → Firestore Database → Create database** → start in **production mode** → pick any region close to you.

### 5. Lock it down with security rules
In Firestore → **Rules** tab, replace the contents with:
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```
This is the important part — it guarantees each signed-in person can only ever read or write their *own* document, never anyone else's.

### 6. Push and test
Commit your filled-in `js/firebase-config.js` and push. Open your GitHub Pages URL, go to **Profile → Account → Sign in with Google**. That's it.

**How the sync actually behaves:**
- Signing in is optional and additive — nothing changes for people who don't sign in.
- It's "last write wins" across devices: every local save is pushed to Firestore a few seconds later (debounced), and signing in on a new device pulls the newest cloud copy down. This is *not* real-time multi-device merging — if you edited the same account on two devices at once while both were offline, whichever reconnects and syncs last will overwrite the other. For the realistic case (one person switching between a phone and a laptop) this is the right amount of complexity.
- The one moment the app asks instead of guessing: signing into a Google account that *already* has cloud data, on a device that *also* already has its own local data. You get an explicit choice — keep the cloud copy or keep this device's copy — rather than silently picking one.
- Signing out never deletes anything locally; it just stops syncing.
- Note: Firestore documents cap out at 1MB. A very photo-heavy Journal (lots of embedded images) could theoretically approach that ceiling over a long time. If that ever becomes a real issue, the fix is moving journal images into Firebase Storage instead of embedding them in the synced document — a further enhancement, not built here.

## Notes

- **Discover's "skip"** is permanent for that book (stored in `S.seenFeed`) — it will not resurface. **"Deal me more"** tracks everything shown this session so it never repeats, and automatically expands the pool via live Open Library search once fewer than 6 unseen local candidates remain.
- **Share cards** are 1080×1920 canvases with a restored brand gradient (gold → ochre → ember) for non-transparent exports; transparent mode drops the fill and the cover entirely so it composites cleanly over your own photo. A history of generated cards lives in Profile → Recent shares for re-sending later, dated so each one still reads as "proof for that day."
- **Monthly Wrap** looks at the *previous* completed calendar month, only after your join date, and won't nag twice — opening it marks it viewed.
- All state lives under one `localStorage` key (`dogeared.state.v2`). Profile → **Export backup** downloads it as JSON; **Import backup** restores it anywhere.
